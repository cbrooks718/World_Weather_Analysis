# World_Weather_Analysis

## A Brief Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to improve the PlanMyTrip app in order for beta testers to identify potential vacation destinations and nearby hotels based on their weather preferences. Then, beta testers will be able to create a travel itinerary based on their choices. In order to execute this, the following tasks were performed:

- Create a DataFrame using imported data from OpenWeatherMap API to store WeatherData (stored in Weather_Database folder)
- Using the retrieved weather data, code will be built out in order for beta testers to imput preferences and see selected destinations on a map
- Last, using the Geoapify Routing API, beta testers will be able to see their selected cities on a map by creating waypoints and generating routs between destinations.
